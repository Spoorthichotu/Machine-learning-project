Abstract:
Attrition analysis is the process of examining and understanding employee turnover in an
organization. The analysis involves collecting and analyzing data on employee departures,
including the reasons for leaving, length of time with the organization, and demographic
information. Additionally, the analysis may involve examining factors that contribute to
employee retention, such as compensation, career development opportunities, and organizational
culture. The goal of attrition analysis is to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in
employee retention efforts to reduce turnover rates and improve organizational performance.
Machine learning is one of the expansively utilized strategies in the direction of Attrition
classification. Here in this paper a three of the supervised Machine learning Algorithms, RF
classifier, Decision tree Classifier and Na√Øve Bayes Classifier is performed. And from the results
it is assured that Random forest classifier performs better than the other two classifiers in terms
of accuracy, Precision and Recall.
